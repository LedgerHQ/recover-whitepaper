# Ledger Recover Cryptographic Protocol White Paper

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Ledger Recover Cryptographic Protocol White Paper! This repository contains the complete text of the technical white paper that delves into the system design, architecture, and operational flows of Ledger Recover.

## Overview

Ledger Recover is an advanced solution for the backup and restoration of your device seed, built upon a robust and resilient cryptographic protocol. The purpose of this repository is to provide open access to the detailed examination of Ledger Recover, with a strong focus on its design and security goals, as well as the three primary operational flows - backing up your seed, restoring it on a new device, and securely deleting your backups.

Publishing this white paper is yet another step in our open-source roadmap, aiming at opening as much as possible of our technical stacks to the crypto community.
